// IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:
//
// A GameAction is something that can be "performed" in steps:
//
// 1. PreReactions     → actions that run before the main performer
// 2. Performer         → the main logic of this action
// 3. PostReactions    → actions that run after the main performer
//
// The ActionSystem executes these actions IN ORDER using a coroutine pipeline
//
// A GameAction can trigger more GameActions → this creates action chains.
// The system ensures everything runs in the correct order, without overlap.

public class ActionSystem : Singleton<ActionSystem>
{
    // STATE :
    public bool IsPerforming { get; private set; } = false; // True when an action is currently running through the Flow() pipeline
    public event Action OnFlowFinished; // Triggered when the entire Flow(action) finishes
    private List<GameAction> currentReactions = null; // Temporary container that points to the current list to process (value adapts during Flow())


    // SUBSCRIBERS :
    // NB : Subscribers are NOT part of the GameAction but plain functions called before/after the action (listeners)
    private static Dictionary<Type, List<Action<GameAction>>> preSubscribers = new(); // All functions that trigger before a game action
    private static Dictionary<Type, List<Action<GameAction>>> postSubscribers = new(); // All functions that trigger after a game action


    // PERFORMERS :
    // The performers dictionary maps each GameAction type to the function that executes it.
    // Example: performers[MoveAction] = MyMovePerformer
    // When ActionSystem needs to run a MoveAction, it looks up the MoveAction performer and executes it.
    private static Dictionary<Type, Func<GameAction, IEnumerator>> performers = new(); // Performers hold the logic for their game action
    // NB : Each action type has exactly one performer that defines how it executes



    // FLOW = the complete lifecycle (flow) of a GameAction:
        // - Runs pre-subscribers (global listeners)
        // - Runs pre-reactions (GameAction-defined actions)
        // - Runs performer (main logic)
        // - Runs perform-reactions (GameAction-defined actions)
